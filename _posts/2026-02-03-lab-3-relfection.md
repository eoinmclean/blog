## What was new
Editing md files was new to me. Writing content using markdown syntax like headings, list, links and images made it clear how Jekyll converts simple text files into structured html pages.

## What I struggled with
I struggled most with navigating everything in the project as there are many files in the project.

## What doesnt make sense (yet)
- how liquid variables and filters work in the theme

## Looking forward
Im looking forward to make the blog more personal and complete, while getting faster at the preview, commit and push workflow.
