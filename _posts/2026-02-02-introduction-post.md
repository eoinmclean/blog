## Setup experience

This is my first time setting up a Jekyll blog with GitHub Pages. The most new part for me was
running a local server and understanding how Jekyll turns Markdown files into a live site.

### What was new to me
- Installing Ruby/Bundler and using `bundle install`
- Running the server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Learning that Jekyll expects a specific folder structure (`_posts`, `_config.yml`)

### What I struggled with
The biggest issue was figuring out where I was in the terminal. I got errors like “Could not locate Gemfile”
until I navigated into the correct repository directory.

### What still doesn’t make sense (yet)
I still need more practice with how layouts and themes work in the background, especially Liquid templates.

Here are two links I used while setting this up:
- [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
- [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)

## Looking forward
I’m looking forward to using this blog for future assignments and getting faster at the workflow:
edit → preview locally → commit → push → check the live site.
